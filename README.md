# GameKeeper
GameKeeper is a solution for game management and monitoring on the ROBLOX.com platform. Many developers are curious on how their games are 
turning out after spending weeks and months of effort into making their dream. ROBLOX does provide some statistics, however, not enough. 
GameKeeper steps in by providing developers with powerful tools to manage their game, and collect statistics on how players are interacting
with their game.
